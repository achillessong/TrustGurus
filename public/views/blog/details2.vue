                        It’s been a decade since the first application of blockade technology which is now involved in revolutionary development. Initially, the block was associated only with the Bitcoin engine and other crypto-currencies. Then his influence reached the financial, trade and media sectors in full. Now, the blockbuster will lead the new era of the automotive industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This database is based on a blockchain which guarantees that the information in it was not tampered with, changed, or allocated. The blockchain guarantees perfect permeability and increases the confidence in the system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Information comes from municipal registers, insurance and leasing companies, various partners, personal registers, commercial APIs and certified members. The information is still being strengthened from transport modes, so the data is updated in real time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        BlockChain will give you reliable information about the machine that you intend to purchase and you can have no doubt about its safety! Information about the car will fall from all members of the system (car manufacturers, insurance companies, car service, banks and leasing companies, dealers, etc.).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The BlockChain plan reduces all data providers and makes an endless situation of the car, without unreliable information from centralized databases, and ensures the data remains unchanged in the direction of the entire savings period using SHA-256 blocking and hashing technology with the cryptographic method (sha 2 generation).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        * The situation of the car, tied to its Block number, will be stored in the BlockChain system and at any time has the ability to be available to users and services that have access to the system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All these components have all the chances to be falsified or sheltered from credible clients (along with almost all other relevant information). Authorities hardly disclose these types of data to the public and even if they do this then a huge fraction of the time shall become irrelevant. This makes the environment of mistrust and uncertainty that affects all members of the market.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        BlockChain is a fresh and innovative platform, which invites the conclusion of this difficulty by applying the power of its technology. They want to combine all the data providers and give the user a perfect endless record of the car. All without defects of the centralized database. Buyers still have every chance to increase the price of their own vehicles during the implementation, contributing to the data warehouse about the BlockChain with the support of vehicles tracking devices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In recent months, the top automobile companies, including BMW, General Motors, Ford and Renault have created a joint block-consortium. Its task is to use the technology of blockade in the automotive industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The name of the joint project of these companies is MOBI (Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative). In total, it included more than 30 companies, including not only automakers, but also companies working in the field of blockbuster. The MOBI Consortium has defined its goal to make transportation and transportation sphere “safer, affordable and cheaper, using the technology of blockage for this.”

                        BlockChain is a decentralized network that allows its users to store Block data in a chain – this guarantees complete data and variability. Users still have all chances to pay for the requirements for the BlockChain with support for BlockChain tokens; then the tokens will be divided among the information providers depending on the value of the proper data.

                    <h4>
                        The 3 Key Advantages:
                    </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No one can change or forge information about the condition or the use of a particular vehicle.</li>
                        <li>With clear information, the roads will become more harmless all over the world.</li>
                        <li>It will develop an association based on trust, for dealers, united by the desire to arrange the bazaar more colorless for buyers.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>More to Come in Blocking</h4>
                    <p>
                        Blockchain development company – Bacancy Technology believes that the use of blocking will prevent the need for a third-party vendor or central processing center to process transactions and teams.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Distributed character instead will allow “reliable and unchanged data recording”.

                        ZF originally announced the Car eWallet system in January, while promising to develop a payment system to help charge electric vehicles. At that time, ZF planned to use the Car eWallet to facilitate the car exchange system, as well as to ensure more secure delivery of packages by placing items directly into the trunk of the car.

                    <p>
                        It is reported that IBM is now using its blockchain infrastructure to further develop a secure system that can perform the required tasks as well as display the information of authorized users that are relevant to their vehicles and carry out transactions in real time.

                    <p>
                        In May, Toyota announced that it would try to develop a blockchain infrastructure to stimulate the development of “autonomous technologies”, including monitoring passenger safety and preventing fraud.
